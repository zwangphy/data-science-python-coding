# data-science-python-coding

Python coding challenges (non-leetcode type problems) commonly asked in data science interviews. 
They include random variable sampling, statistical simulation, ML and statistical model implementation, etc.


The title of each problem directs to the notebook file. Texts below title are the description of the problem.

## 1. [weighted sampling](/solutions/weighted_sampling.ipynb)

You are given n numbers in an array `nums`, as well as probabilities <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}"> which sum up to 1 in an array `probs`. How would you generate one of the n numbers according to the specified probabilities?

For example, if the numbers are 3, 5, 7, 11, and the probabilities are 9/18, 6/18, 2/18, 1/18, then 1000000 calls to your program, 3 should appear roughly 500000 times, 5 should appear roughly 333333 times, 7 should appear roughly 111111 times, and 11 should appear roughly 55555 times.

## 2. [simulating e = 2.718...](/solutions/simulating_e.ipynb)

You generate one uniform random number at a time between 0 and 1 in the following two scenarios.

* If the current random number is greater than the previous number, you continue to generate one more random number. 
  The process stops when you generate a random number that is smaller than the previous one. 
  What is the expected number of random numbers you generate?
* You stop generating random numbers only if the sum of all random numbers generated by far is larger than one.
  What is the expected number of random numbers you generate? 
  
Answer these two questions analytically and then run simulation in Python to verify your results.

## 3. [reservoir sampling](/solutions/reservoir_sampling.ipynb)

There is a list `S` containing n items, where n is unknown or too large to fit the whole list to main memory. 
Write a Python program to randomly sample k items from the input list without replacement.
